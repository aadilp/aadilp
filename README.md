Hi, I'm Aadil (pronouns: he/him/his), a Software Engineer based in Toronto.

I mainly work as a Full Stack Engineer, but leaning more towards backend technologies. The languages I have worked with include Kotlin, Java, PHP, Python and JavaScript (usually React, no backend).

The areas I'd like to explore more of are Software Architecture and Infrastructure.
